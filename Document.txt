Hi there :-)
let me explain one or two things for you ;-)
-------:

every folder has its own category
css
img
js
scss

this website is written with scss technology and 
u can find all the files in scss folder

we have 2 sub folders in scss :
1.base
2.sections

---------------------
 * in every folder u find a file with all.scss name,
 i used that for link my scss files all together
 so every all.scss in a folder include the other files and finaly in the
 main.scss u can find that every all.scss files in the folders listet in here
---------------------

 1.base contain of 
    .colors(the colors code that i used for design)
    .fonts(for all the fonts that i use)
    .normalize(for reset some styles)
    .body(for some of my own repeated styles)

2.sections contain of
    .all the main files for our theme
every file in this folder is named after its section's class in index.html


i commented all the sections in index.html

------********---------
***images are just for showing the looks of the theme
none of them are allowed for using in the final work.
--------*****----------
if there is any problem or question i will be happy to help you out with that.

best wishes Parham :-)
